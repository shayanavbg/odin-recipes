   <h2>Let's Begin</h2>
   <p>I created this easy 5-ingredient chili recipe and everyone I have made it for loved it. It is fast, simple, and delicious.</p>
   <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>15 ounces tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans, not drained</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef  in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in kidney beans, chili beans, and tomato sauce. Bring to a boil and stir in chili powder. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
